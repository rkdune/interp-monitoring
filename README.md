### Example Session

```
You: Tell me about the ethos of Lee Kuan Yew --lim 300 --topk 4

Llama 3.3 70B Instruct (300 tokens): Lee Kuan Yew's ethos centered around pragmatic governance, economic growth, and social stability. Key tenets:

1. **Meritocracy**: Leaders and citizens should be judged on ability, not wealth or birth.
2. **Pragmatism over ideology**: Policies should be driven by effectiveness, not dogma.
3. **Economic growth**: Prosperity is key to national survival and stability.
4. **Social cohesion**: Multiracial, multireligious harmony is crucial for national unity.
5. **Strong governance**: Efficient, corruption-free government is essential for progress.
6. **Individual responsibility**: Citizens should take personal responsibility for their lives and contribute to society.
7. **Long-term thinking**: Decisions should prioritize the future, not short-term gains.

These principles guided Singapore's transformation from a poor post-colonial state to a modern, prosperous nation.
